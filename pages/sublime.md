>The text editor you'll fall in love with...

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.



Install
-------

I'm still using version2 that you can [download here](https://www.sublimetext.com/2).  
Then drag to your dock for easy access.

After evaluation you can [buy a licence here](https://www.sublimetext.com/buy).


Setup
-----

### Set Sublime as your default text editor

1. Find the file type you'd like to open with a specific app, and select it
2. Click on the File menu and select Get Info
3. Expand Open with: by clicking on the triangle to the left
4. Select the Open with: menu, then choose the app you'd like to use to open all documents like that one

### Use a different icon

I prefer [this icon](/assets/media/SublimeOrange.icns) to match the Yosemite ones

To change an apps icon:

1. Right click the app in finder (eg applications/Sublime Text 2) and choose "Get Info"
2. Drag and drop the new icon on the small, top left icon in the Get Info panel



### Install package manager 

For simpler installation of sublime packages (add-ons) first install the package manager:

[Follow these instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st2)

You can then open the command pallette with <code>cmd+shift+p</code> and then type <code>Install package</code> to search for packages to install

### Add other colour schemes

Change the default colour scheme using <code>Preferences > Colour scheme</code>

I like Solarized dark, although its not very good for markdown, so I'm currently using __Cobalt__


### Other interesting packages

* [Clickable URLs](https://github.com/noahcoad/open-url)
* Solarized colour scheme
* [Neon color scheme for working with JSON](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Neon%20Color%20Scheme) plus view .geojson as type "json" not "text" - its under View > Syntax > Javascript (& View > Syntax > Open all ...)

Tips
----

__Cmd-J = join lines__  
Use to convert multi lines (select all to do all in one 1 go) into 1 line (that can view over multi lines with word wrap)
