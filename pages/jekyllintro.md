>Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) takes plain text files plus template files and spits out a functional  website, with no need for a database. This makes it simple, fast, secure and scalable.

* Edit your content in a text editor -- a great way to focus on the content, not the technology
* When you save changes Jekyll automatically builds your website
* You can preview in your browser 
* Then push to a webserver for the world to view

Using __markdown__ simple text files like this:

{% highlight markdown %}
A header
--------

This is just a regular paragraph.

And a second paragraph with some __bold__ and _italic_ text

> This is a blockquote

* Lists are 
* easy too
{% endhighlight %}

become beautiful webpages like this:

A header
--------

This is just a regular paragraph.

And a second paragraph with some __bold__ and _italic_ text

> This is a blockquote

* Lists are 
* easy too
