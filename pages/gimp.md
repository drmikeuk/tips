### Darken / lighten image

You can use the [levels](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tool-levels.html) tool to make an image lighter or darker or to change the contrast.

[See this tutorial](http://www.lpgallery.mb.ca/gimp/g4.htm) with nice "before and after" examples of dark & low contrast photos.


Putting it all together
-----------------------

Aim: take a section of [this 3223Ã—2558 pixel 19th Century map of London](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11132833506/) and make a 1000x200 pixel pale background image.

![Original map of London](/assets/media/london_small.jpg)  <i class="fa fa-arrow-right fa-2x" aria-hidden="true" style="padding: 10px"></i> ![Final map](/assets/media/london-final.jpg){: style="max-width: 50%;"}

### Outline

1. Select an area of interest using the the rectangle select tool
	* it doesnt matter if this is wider than our target 1000 pixels -- we will resize later
	* make the selection higher than needed -- we will crop this later
1. Crop: Image > Crop to selection
1. Resize to target width: Image > Scale image: 1000 pixels
1. Adjust to target height: Image > Canvas size: Height = 200 pixels (& change offset Y to move selection down if required)
1. Lighten: Tools > Colour tools > Levels: change input levels to 192
1. Save as new file: File > Export as
